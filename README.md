A simple Rock paper Scissors game where the oponent will be a computer.
We will randomly generate the computer move between 1 to 5 and based on that number we will asign a computer move.
We will display the computer move along with the player move once we start playing and the counts of wins and defeats will be displayed.
At the bottom we will display a Text stating that the player won or lost.
The pirticulat image will be highlited when we click.
